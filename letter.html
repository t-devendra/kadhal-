    <p>
        Today isn’t just your birthday.<br>
It’s a reminder that the world once decided to place you in it and somehow, my life brushed past that decision.
    </p>
  
    
    <p>
        I won’t pretend I know everything about you.<br> 
I don’t.
I only know the version of you that stayed with me in silences, in half-spoken thoughts, in moments that didn’t ask to be named. And that was enough to change the way I look at things.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You taught me something without ever trying<br> 
that care doesn’t need possession,
that closeness doesn’t always come from holding on,
and that some feelings are meant to be carried quietly, like a fragile truth. 
    </p>

    
    <p>
        If I’ve ever loved you, it was never loudly.<br>
It was in restraint.<br> 
In choosing not to ask for more.
In letting you be exactly who you are, even when it meant standing a little apart.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        I don’t know where life is taking you next, but I hope it is kind.
I hope it gives you days that feel light, nights that feel safe, and people who never make you doubt your worth. And if somewhere along the way you remember me, I hope it’s gently without weight, without regret.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        This isn’t a promise.<br> 
It isn’t a request.<br>
It’s just the truth I allow myself today.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        <b>Happy Birthday Antra.</b> <br>
Always here.
